The inplementation of Deep Learning Face Representation from Predicting 10,000 Classes (DeepID1)

Limited by equipment performance, I reduce the number of images patches from 60 to 12. 
I've tried to contact the author to get the data set used in their work, but they just ignored my email.
So I used a subset of VGG face data set.

Personally ,I do not recommend this data set...

In fact I need to train a verification model to accomplish my work, but limited by equipment performance, I give up...
Just using a simple cosine distance to verify.
